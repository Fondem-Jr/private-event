# Project: Private Events - Associations


In this project, we build a private event web app where members can register attendance for an event or being able to create an event. Inside this app, members can see a list of past and upcoming events, if the customer is not already logged out they can only see the entire list, but they can't create or register attendance. You can find in this project relations among three tables to register users, events, and attendance. You can get the full project description [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/associations).

This project uses devise gem to create the authentication in Ruby on Rails. We encourage you to use it because it's the easiest way to make a complete authentication, and you can customize it if you want to do it.
